### Note that this is a TEST project
This project was created as a means to assess and enhance my skills in software development. As of the moment, the project remains in a preliminary stage and has yet to be developed into a fully-functional application due to the current limitations in technology at my disposal.

I regret to inform those who were anticipating the utilization of this application for professional purposes that it may not be feasible at this time. In the interim, I recommend considering alternative platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, until such time that the development of the aforementioned application can be resumed.
